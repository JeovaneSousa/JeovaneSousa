ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JeovaneSousa

I'm a technology enthusiast , Jiu Jitsu Practitioner, and guitar player.

But, most importantly, I'm a future Software Developer in constant and eternal learning process.

I'm fully committed to improve daily and learn constantly about this vast and incredible field of study.

I use platforms such as Digital Innovation One, Datacamp, Udemy and EDX to learn new skills. I'm also currently enrolled in a System Analysis and Development degree at EstÃ¡cio University
